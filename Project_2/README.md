# Speech Translation

Welcome to the Speech Translation project! üåç

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to create a powerful translation service for local dialects, including Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa, using Microsoft AI services. Our goal is to enable seamless communication across language barriers by translating both speech and text from English to the language of your choice.

## üõà Project Details

### Leveraging Azure Services

We will harness the capabilities of Microsoft Azure, specifically the Speech Service and Translation Service, to build this translation solution. Whether you have an audio message or text in English, our system will provide translations to Yoruba, Igbo, or Hausa.

### Community Integration

This project has the potential to make a significant impact on communities and groups facing language barriers. Once developed, this solution can be further deployed to chatbots or other devices, making it accessible to a broader audience especially localities which need such a solution.
