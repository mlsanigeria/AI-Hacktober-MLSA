# Contributing to the Hacktoberfest Repository

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest repository organized by the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors in Nigeria! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our projects. Please read this guide to understand how you can participate and make meaningful contributions.

## How to Install Dependencies and Work on the Project Locally

From your terminal:

Clone your forked repository and name it `AI-Hacktober-MLSA`

```
# Replace {user_name} with your GitHub username
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/{user_name}/AI-Hacktober-MLSA.git
```
> This makes sure you clone only the most recent commit and all files to avoid cloning every commit history as image files have been resized and hence will only take space on your local machine for what you don't need.

Create a virtual environment with the name (`AI-Hacktober-MLSA`)

```
# Windows
python -m venv AI-Hacktober-MLSA

# macOS or Linux
python -m venv AI-Hacktober-MLSA
```

Activate the created virtual environment
```
# Windows
AI-Hacktober-MLSA\Scripts\activate

#macOS or Linux
source AI-Hacktober-MLSA/bin/activate
```

Then install the necessary dependencies.

``` 
cd AI-Hacktober-MLSA
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Evaluation Metric

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
We evaluate the performance of the machine learning model using the Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE). The RMSE is calculated using the predicted normalized GPA values and actual normalized GPA values from the dataset. [Check the starter notebook for more information](https://github.com/mlsanigeria/AI-Hacktober-MLSA/blob/main/Project_3/GPA_Prediction_{GitHub_Username}/GPA_prediction.ipynb).

- Your contribution should aim to improve the RMSE metric.
- PRs will be reviewed based on the improvement they bring to the RMSE.
- A minimum standard for RMSE score for merging PRs will be set and communicated to you in your PR.
