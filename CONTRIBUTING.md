# Contributing to Hacktoberfest Repository

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest repository organized by the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors in Nigeria! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our projects. Please read this guide to understand how you can participate and make meaningful contributions.

## Project 1: Image Classification of Building Types

In this project, you will work on image classification tasks. We have provided a starter notebook for you to begin your work.

### Contribution Guidelines

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Create a folder under the `Project_1` directory with the following naming convention:
   - Folder Name: `Image_Classification_{GitHub_Username}`
   
   For example, if your GitHub username is `octocat`, your folder should be named `Image_Classification_octocat`.

3. Within your personal folder, you have your own environment to create your notebook and workspace.

4. Work on your image classification tasks in your notebook.

5. The minimum contribution a user can make is on preprocessing of the data(images).

6. For contributions related to modeling, the model's performance must achieve a minimun of 60% accuracy to be considered valid.

7. The team will perform an evaluation of the model using a seperate test dataset to verify its performance score.

8. When you are ready, make a pull request to the main repository.

## Project 2: Speech Translation

Project 2 involves enhancing existing scripts. We have provided starter scripts along with a `requirements.txt` file.

### Contribution Guidelines

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Create a virtual environment for the project using the provided `requirements.txt` file. You can follow this [video tutorial](link-to-video-tutorial) for detailed instructions on setting up your environment. This applies to both Project 1 and Project 2.

3. Edit, fine-tune, or create new functions in the scripts to add new features or improvements.

4. Test your changes thoroughly in your virtual environment.

5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

6. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.


## Project 3: Prediction of Nigerian Student's Year One Performance

In this project, you will work on a regression task. We have provided a starter notebook for you to begin your work.

### Contribution Guidelines

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Create a folder under the `Project_3` directory with the following naming convention:
   - Folder Name: `GPA_Prediction_{GitHub_Username}`
   
   For example, if your GitHub username is `octocat`, your folder should be named `GPA_Prediction_octocat`.

3. Within your personal folder, you have your own environment to create your notebook and workspace.

4. Work on your regression task in your notebook.

### Evaluation Metric

We evaluate the performance of the machine learning model using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The RMSE is calculated using the predicted GPA values and  actual normalized GPA values from the dataset. [Check sample notebook for more information]("\Project_3\GPA_Prediction_{GitHub_Username}\GPA_prediction.ipynb")

- Your contribution should aim to improve the RMSE metric.
- PRs will be reviewed based on the improvement they bring to the RMSE.
- A minimum standard for RMSE score for merging PRs will be set and communicated to you in your PR.

## General Guidelines

- Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices.

- Make sure to create a descriptive pull request explaining the purpose of your changes.

- Be respectful and collaborative. Feel free to ask questions and seek assistance from other contributors or maintainers.

- Happy hacking! We appreciate your contributions to make this project better.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to reach out to us.

**Happy Hacking!**
