# Nigerian Student's Year One Performance Prediction Project

Welcome to the Year One GPA Prediction Project! 📚

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to build a Tabular Machine Learning model that predicts the Year One GPA (Grade Point Average) of Nigerian students based on various features. These features include Jamb scores, Waec grades, experiences during the first-year session, reading patterns, consistency of class attendance, and more.

## Project Details

### Data Collection with Microsoft Forms

We will be collecting the necessary data anonymously using Microsoft Forms. Contributors will have the opportunity to participate in the data collection process. The data collected will be used to train and test our predictive model.

### Phases of Contribution

Contributors will participate in three key phases:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect and contribute data points that will be vital for training the predictive model. Your participation in this phase will be crucial in building an accurate and representative dataset.

2. **Modelling**: Work on building, training, and fine-tuning the machine learning model. Collaborate with others to enhance the accuracy of the prediction.

3. **Deployment**: Deploy the model to the web using Streamlit, making it accessible to users. Users will be able to input various details about themselves and their study habits to get a prediction of their possible GPA at the end of the first year.

## Get Started

To contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Review the Contribution Guidelines**: Take a look at the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/mlsanigeria/AI-Hacktober-MLSA/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand how to contribute effectively.

2. **Data Collection**: If you wish to participate in data collection, access this [survey form](https://forms.office.com/r/Q6QqNzTasn).

3. **Modelling**: Once the data is collected, the modelling phase will begin. You can contribute to building and improving the machine learning model.

4. **Deployment**: Help in deploying the project to the web using Streamlit and make it user-friendly for predictions.
