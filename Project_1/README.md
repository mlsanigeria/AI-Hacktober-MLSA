# Image Classification

Welcome to this Image Classification Project! üè¢

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to create a robust image classification system that can identify different types of buildings, specifically:

- **Bungalows**
- **Storey Buildings**
- **High-Rise Buildings (including skyscrapers)**

Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify buildings into these categories based on images provided by contributors.

## üõà Project Details

### Deployment with Streamlit

The core of this project will be deployed to the web using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications. Users will be able to upload pictures of buildings they've taken, and the deployed model will classify the building type.

### Data Collection

To train our model effectively, we need a diverse and extensive dataset of building images. This is where you, our valuable contributors, come in! You can help us collect and organize the data by:

1. Taking pictures of buildings and classifying them into one of the three categories (Bungalow, Storey Building, or High-Rise Building).
2. Uploading the images to the appropriate folders, clearly labeled within the repository, based on the building type.

## ü§î Get Started

To contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1. Review the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/mlsanigeria/AI-Hacktober-MLSA/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand how to contribute effectively.

2. Explore the [Starter Notebook](https://github.com/mlsanigeria/AI-Hacktober-MLSA/blob/main/Project_1/Image_Classification_%7BGitHub_Username%7D/Image_Classification.ipynb) provided. This notebook contains code to get you started on building and training the classification model.

3. Start contributing by adding your own images and improving the model. We encourage collaboration and look forward to your contributions!
